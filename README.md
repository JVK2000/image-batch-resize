
### **How to Run the Script:**

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

2. **Run the Script with Command-Line Arguments:**

   The script accepts three arguments:
   - `input_folder`: Path to the folder containing the images to resize.
   - `output_folder`: Path to the folder where resized images will be saved.
   - `resolution`: The target resolution (width and height) for resizing.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python image_batch_resize.py "C:\path\to\input_folder" "C:\path\to\output_folder" 256 256
   ```

   **Replace the paths** with your own folder paths and specify the resolution (e.g., 256 256 for square images).
